## Implementation approach

We will upgrade the existing project to Astro@4.9.1, ensuring compatibility and leveraging its latest features for better performance and scalability. TailwindCSS@3.4.3 will be integrated for responsive and visually appealing UI designs. The project will be structured to be maintainable and easy to update, even without the integration of CI/CD tools.

## File list

- src/pages/index.astro
- src/components/Navbar.astro
- tailwind.config.js
- astro.config.mjs

## Data structures and interfaces

    class AstroApp {
        +start() void
    }
    class TailwindCSS {
        +applyStyles() void
    }
    AstroApp --> TailwindCSS : uses


## Program call flow
